This is my First Software, which I have deployed to my local market to create bills.
I have provided an .exe file in the dist (This is for Fakhar Enterprises & Light World).
I have also provided the source code of that .exe file, so you can edit the name and use it for your own, or you can make an update, and add more features.

This Software uses
- sqlite-jdbc-3.51.1.0
- pdfbox-app-3.0.6
- javafx-sdk-21.0.7

I have provided the .exe file so you can see and experience the interface and working of the software.
If you want to run .exe, you just need to have javafx-sdk-21.0.7 in your C:\javafx-sdk-21.0.7, and the software will execute normally.
